Highveld Bot

An AI assistant for Highveld Biotech that answers client questions about lab testing, pricing, and logistics.
Built with LangChain to demonstrate how language models + retrieval can provide reliable, source-grounded answers.


 Project Goals
- Provide concise, professional answers to customer questions.
-  Always cite sources (so clients can trust the response).
- Escalate complex queries to human follow-up (e.g., book a call with business development team.
-  Appear helpful and approachable, not overly technical.

Build Milestones

Phase 1 ‚Äî Tracer Bullet MVP
	‚Ä¢	Ingest lab_faq.csv ‚Üí embed ‚Üí vector store.
	‚Ä¢	Retrieval-augmented chain with {context} + {question}.
	‚Ä¢	CLI app to ask one question and get answer + cited source.
	‚Ä¢	Create eval_set.jsonl (10 customer Qs).

Phase 2 ‚Äî Improve Quality
	‚Ä¢	Tune chunk size & retriever top_k.
	‚Ä¢	Prompt refinement: require exact quotes for prices/dates.
	‚Ä¢	Evaluate accuracy (target ‚â•80% contains-check).

Phase 3 ‚Äî Memory & UX
	‚Ä¢	Add conversation memory for follow-up queries.
	‚Ä¢	Add escalation route for ‚Äúcomplex query ‚Üí book a call‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	Lightweight Streamlit demo with chat interface.

Phase 4 ‚Äî Extra Tools (Optional)
	‚Ä¢	Calculator for turnaround times.
	‚Ä¢	Quote generator (draft emails).
	‚Ä¢	Multi-source ingestion (PDFs, spreadsheets, website data).

‚∏ª

üîç Evaluation
	‚Ä¢	Use eval_runner.py to test bot on eval_set.jsonl.
	‚Ä¢	Track:
	‚Ä¢	Accuracy (% correct or partially correct answers).
	‚Ä¢	Faithfulness (no hallucinations).
	‚Ä¢	Latency (response time).


New features and settings
- Price integrity guard (no invented prices).
- Score/distance gate for weak retrieval matches.
- Prompt versioning for traceability.
- Optional persistent memory (SQLite) for conversation summaries.
- Simple per-IP rate limiting.
- SSE streaming endpoint.
